# Deviation Example No. 1

The building schedule can only be met until the fourth time step. At this point
the storage is depleted and can no longer compensate the deviations.

Note that the storage compensates the deviations of the fixed load and the
space heating. To do so it not only increases its output to compensate the
deviations from the space heating but even further increases so that the
electric heater can reduce its power and thus compensate the deviation of the
fixed load.

**Note:** In contrast to the robust example we compare the schedule and the
actual schedule with each other instead of two schedules from different
schedulings.
