# Robust Example No. 1

When robust optimization (RO) is used (lower rows) the storage cannot fully be
utilized. This is best seen in time step 3 where the SoC is lower than without
robust scheduling.

Naturally, the schedule becomes less optimal with RO. This is shown by the
higher costs for the robust schedule. You can also see how the building can
completely satisfy its demand during the times of low prices, when no RO is
used. With RO however, the building has to shift some demand into the times of
high prices.

**Note:** We compare two schedules from different schedulings with each other.
