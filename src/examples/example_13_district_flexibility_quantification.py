    # The city district's maximum operational flexibility potential in terms of the absolute flexibility gain metric can

    # flexibility gain is a measure for the energy shifted between a coordinated and an uncoordinated scheduling
    # scenario. Here, the coordinated case is represented through the central optimization algorithm, whereas the
    # uncoordinated case is represented through the stand-alone optimization algorithm.

    return


# Conclusions:
# In the given scenario, the absolute flexibility gain within the city district scenario is about 754kWh for the defined
# day (24h). This means that up to this volume of energy can be shifted because of the local flexibility potentials.
# For example, this flexibility potential can be used to achieve several system level services such as peak-shaving.
# The quantification of the flexibility potential is usually a crucial task when it comes to the initial assessment of
# local energy systems and/or city district energy systems.
