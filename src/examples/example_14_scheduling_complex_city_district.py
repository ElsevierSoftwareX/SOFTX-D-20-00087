# Conclusions:
# The power scheduling for a complex city district scenario can be done easily using pycity_scheduling. Even more than
# 100 (TABULA) buildings could be considered, but this might lead to scalability issues when using the central
# optimization algorithm. Thus, with a growing number buildings, distributed algorithms such as dual decomposition or
# ADMM should be applied.
