# Conclusions:
# If Robust Optimization (RO) is applied, the flexibility of the thermal energy storage is not fully used. This is best
# seen in the first four time steps, where the state-of-charge (SOC) is lower than without the robust approach. Instead,
# the 'energy difference' is used to cater for uncertainties that may stem from an uncertain thermal demand of the
# building. As a trade-off, the RO schedule becomes always less optimal (by means of the objective value) than without
# RO. This becomes evident by the higher costs for the robust case compared to the non-robust case in this example.
