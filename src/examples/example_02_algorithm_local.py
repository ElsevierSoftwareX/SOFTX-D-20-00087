# Conclusions:
# If the local optimization algorithm is applied, the two buildings are scheduled in a way so that they only satisfy
# their local objectives (which is a 'price' optimization here). Local flexibility is not used to achieve the system
# level objective. For this reason, it should be used for reference scheduling purposes only to analyze the
# 'uncoordinated' case.
