# Conclusion:
# In contrast to the uncoordinated case (stand-alone algorithm) both the total costs as well as the power peaks are
# (slightly) reduced in the coordinated case in this exemplary scheduling case. This is because of the price and
# peak-shaving objectives of the buildings and the city district. In general, the evaluation of different metrics
# constitutes a helpful step when it comes to the comparison of different city district setups and/or power scheduling
# algorithms.
