# Conclusions:
# Using "max-consumption" as the system level objective results in a power profile with the smallest peak power for the
# considered city district over time. In other words, this means that a certain electrical power threshold at the city
# district's connection point is not exceeded by taking advantage of the local flexibility of the buildings' assets. A
# power profile with a small peak power (which is most certainly a "flat" power profile) is usually the preferred system
# operation from the viewpoint of a network operator and/or district operator.
