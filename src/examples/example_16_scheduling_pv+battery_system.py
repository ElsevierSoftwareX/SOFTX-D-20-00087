# Conclusions:
# To satisfy the desired peak-shaving objectives of the local building and the city district, it becomes evident that
# the battery storage unit is scheduled in a way that power is charged during times of a PV generation surplus (i.e.,
# noon time). Vice versa, it is discharged during times of a PV generation shortage (i.e., during the night). Moreover,
# the battery storage unit is used to better cope with the fluctuating power consumption/generation inside the building.
