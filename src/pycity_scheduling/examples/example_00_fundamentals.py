# This is a fundamental tutorial on how to use the pycity_scheduling package.


def main(do_plot=False):
    print("\n\n------ Example 00: Fundamentals ------\n\n")

    # 1) Environment objects:


    # (Almost) every object within pycity_scheduling requires an environment. The environment object holds general data,
    # which is valid for all objects within pycity_scheduling, such as time data, weather data or energy market prices.
    # Therefore, all objects point to an environment. The first step is usually to generate such an environment.

    # Generate a timer object for the environment:
    timer = Timer(step_size=3600, op_horizon=24, initial_date=(2015, 1, 1), initial_time=(0, 0, 0))

    # Generate a weather object for the environment:
    weather = Weather(timer=timer)

    # Generate a price object for the environment:
    price = Prices(timer=timer)

    # Generate the environment object:
    environment = Environment(timer=timer, weather=weather, prices=price)


    # Now there is a distinct environment object with timer, weather and price data.
    # We can use it to access different data of interest.

    # For example, print the current weekday:
    print('Weekday:')
    print(environment.timer.weekday)

    # For example, print the weather forecast for the outdoor temperature (only extract the first 10 timestep values):
    print('\nOutdoor temperature forecast:')
    print(environment.weather.getWeatherForecast(getTAmbient=True)[0][:10])

    # For example, print the energy spot market day-ahead prices:
    print('\nDay-ahead spot market prices on 2015/01/01:')
    print(environment.prices.da_prices)


    # 2) Buildings objects:

    # After defining the environment, different building objects should be created. In pycity_scheduling, buildings
    # represent the different customers of the local energy system / city district under investigation.
    # In general, buildings should also be understood in a more abstract way. For instance, a building object must not
    # necessarily represent a building structure, as it would be the case for a wind energy converter.

    # Create a building object:
    building = Building(environment=environment)

    # This building is assumed to be equipped with a building energy system and one apartment (=single-family house).
    # In general, every building object can, however, hold up to N different apartments (=multi-family house).
    apartment = Apartment(environment=environment)
    bes = BuildingEnergySystem(environment=environment)

    building.addMultipleEntities([apartment, bes])


    # Every apartment usually possesses both electrical and thermal loads:
    # The electrical load is added to the apartment as follows:
    load = FixedLoad(environment=environment, method=1, annual_demand=3000)

    # Print and show the electrical power curve in Watt:
    print('\nElectrical load in Watt:')
    print(load.get_power(currentValues=False))
    plt.plot(load.get_power(currentValues=False))
    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')
    plt.ylabel('Electrical power in Watt (fixed load)')
    plt.title('Fixed load power curve')
    if do_plot:
        plt.show()

    # The thermal load is added to the apartment as follows:
    space_heating = SpaceHeating(environment=environment, method=1, living_area=150, specific_demand=100)

    # Print and show space heating power curve in Watt:
    print('\nSpace heating power curve in Watt:')
    print(space_heating.get_power(currentValues=False))

    plt.plot(space_heating.get_power(currentValues=False))
    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')
    plt.ylabel('Thermal power in Watt (space heating)')
    plt.title('Space heating power curve')
    if do_plot:
        plt.show()

    apartment.addMultipleEntities([load, space_heating])


    # The BuildingEnergySystem (BES) class is a 'container' for all kind of building energy systems (i.e., electrical
    # and/or thermal assets). For example, we can add an electro-thermal heating system (such as a heatpump plus thermal
    # energy storage) and a photovoltaic unit to a building's BES as done below. In pycity_scheduling all BES devices
    # automatically come with basic scheduling models, which include the required Pyomo optimization variables and
    # several optimization constraints.
    eh = HeatPump(environment=environment, p_th_nom=16.0)
    ths = ThermalHeatingStorage(environment=environment, e_th_max=20.0, soc_init=0.5, loss_factor=0)
    pv = Photovoltaic(environment=environment, method=0, peak_power=8.0)

    bes.addMultipleDevices([eh, ths, pv])

    # Verify if the assets were added successfully (method getHasDevice):
    print('\nBES has heatpump? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, heatpump=True)[0])
    print('BES has thermal heating storage? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, ths=True)[0])
    print('BES has photovoltaic? : ', bes.getHasDevices(all_devices=False, pv=True)[0])


    # 3) CityDistrict objects:

    # In pycity_scheduling, a group of buildings form a CityDistrict object. The CityDistrict is the object to be
    # "provided" to a power scheduling algorithm later on. In other word, it encapsulates all buildings together with
    # their local assets and it hence includes all the optimization problem information and data.

    # Create a city district object:
    cd = CityDistrict(environment=environment)

    # Add the building from above to the city district at a certain position/coordinate (x, y).
    cd.addEntity(entity=building, position=[0, 0])

    # Define and add three other buildings:
    for i in range(3):
        heat_demand = SpaceHeating(environment=environment, method=1, living_area=150, specific_demand=100)

        el_load_demand = FixedLoad(environment=environment, method=1, annual_demand=3000)

        pv = Photovoltaic(environment=environment, method=0, peak_power=5.0)
        bl = Boiler(environment=environment, p_th_nom=24.0)

        ap = Apartment(environment=environment)
        ap.addEntity(heat_demand)
        ap.addEntity(el_load_demand)

        bes = BuildingEnergySystem(environment=environment)
        bes.addDevice(pv)
        bes.addDevice(bl)

        bd = Building(environment=environment)
        bd.addEntity(entity=ap)
        bd.addEntity(entity=bes)

        cd.addEntity(entity=bd, position=[0, i])

    # Print the city district information:
    print('\nTotal number of buildings in city district:')
    print(cd.get_nb_of_building_entities())
    print("\nDetailed city district information:")
    debug.print_district(cd, 3)


    # 4) Power scheduling:

    # The final step is to schedule the buildings/assets inside the city district subject to a certain optimization
    # objective, which can be, for example, peak-shaving. The scheduling is then performed by the user by "passing"
    # the city district object to a certain power scheduling algorithm.
    # Here, the central optimization algorithm is used.

    # Set the city district / district operator objective and perform the power scheduling using the central
    # optimization algorithm:
    cd.set_objective("peak-shaving")
    opt = CentralOptimization(cd)
    opt.solve()

    # The scheduling results obtained from the algorithm run can be (temporally) stored as follows:
    cd.copy_schedule("my_central_scheduling")

    # Print and show the scheduling result (city district power values for every time slot within the defined
    # optimization horizon):
    print("\nPower schedule of city district:")
    print(list(cd.p_el_schedule))

    plt.plot(cd.p_el_schedule, drawstyle='steps')
    plt.xlabel('Time in hours')
    plt.ylabel('Electrical power in Kilowatt')
    plt.title('Electrical Power Schedule of CityDistrict')
