    Extension of pyCity_base class Boiler for scheduling purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment : pycity_scheduling.classes.Environment
        Common to all other objects. Includes time and weather instances.
    p_th_nom : float
        Nominal heat output in [kW].
    eta : float, optional
        Efficiency of the gas boiler (without unit).
    lower_activation_limit : float, optional (only adhered to in integer mode)
        Must be in [0, 1]. Lower activation limit of the gas boiler as a
        percentage of the rated power. When the gas boiler is in operation, its
        power must be zero or between the lower activation limit and its
        rated power.

        - `lower_activation_limit = 0`: Linear behavior
        - `lower_activation_limit = 1`: Two-point controlled

    Notes
    -----
    - Gas boilers offer sets of constraints for operation. In the `convex` mode the
      following constraints and bounds are generated by the boiler:

    .. math::
        0 \\geq p_{th\\_heat} \\geq -p_{th\\_nom}

    - See also:
        - pycity_scheduling.util.generic_constraints.LowerActivationLimit:
          Generates additional constraints for the `lower_activation_limit` in `integer` mode.
