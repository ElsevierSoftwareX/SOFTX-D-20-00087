    Extension of pyCity_base class Building for scheduling purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment : Environment
        Common to all other objects. Includes time and weather instances.
    objective : str, optional
        Objective for the scheduling. The default is 'price'.

        - 'price' : Optimize for the prices given by `prices.tou_prices`.
        - 'co2' : Optimize for the CO2 emissions given by `prices.co2_prices`.
        - 'peak-shaving' : Try to flatten the schedule as much as possible.
        - 'max-consumption' : Try to reduce the maximum of the absolute values of the schedule as much as possible.
        - 'none' : No objective (leave all flexibility to other participants).
    name : str, optional
        Name for the building.
        If name is None, set it to self._long_id.
    profile_type : str, optional
        Thermal SLP profile name
        Requires `method=1`

        - 'HEF' : Single family household
        - 'HMF' : Multi family household
        - 'GBA' : Bakeries
        - 'GBD' : Other services
        - 'GBH' : Accommodations
        - 'GGA' : Restaurants
        - 'GGB' : Gardening
        - 'GHA' : Retailers
        - 'GHD' : Summed load profile business, trade and services
        - 'GKO' : Banks, insurances, public institutions
        - 'GMF' : Household similar businesses
        - 'GMK' : Automotive
        - 'GPD' : Paper and printing
        - 'GWA' : Laundries
    building_type : str, optional
        Build year profile name, the detailed list is implemented in
        `tabula_data.py`.
    storage_end_equality : bool, optional
        `True` if the soc at the end of the scheduling has to be equal to
        the initial soc.
        `False` if it has to be greater or equal than the initial soc.

    Notes
    -----
    - The exchange of thermal energy between different buildings is currently not supported.
      As a result, the building adds the following set of constrains additionally to the
      ones of the EntityContainer:

    .. math::
        p_{th\\_heat} &=& 0 \\\\
        p_{th\\_cool} &=& 0

    - The building can also add robustness constrains for thermal heating storage:

    .. math::
        e_{u\\_bound} \\geq \\sum_i e_{th\\_heat\\_i} \\geq e_{l\\_bound} \\\\

    - The :math:`E_{u\\_bound}` and :math:`E_{l\\_bound}` are determined by the
      robustness parameter, the available capacity of thermal heating storage, the magnitude of heating
      required by SpaceHeating and the magnitude of heating that can be produced by the building's heating units.
