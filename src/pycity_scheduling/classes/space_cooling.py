    """
    Extension of pyCity_base class SpaceCooling for scheduling purposes.

    As for all uncontrollable loads, the `p_th_schedule` contains the forecast
    of the load.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment : Environment object
        Common to all other objects. Includes time and weather instances
    method : integer, optional
        - `0` : Provide load curve directly
        - `1` : Use thermal standard load profile (not implemented yet!)
    loadcurve : Array-like, optional
        Load curve for all investigated time steps
        Requires `method=0`
    living_area : Float, optional
        Living area of the apartment in m^2
        Requires `method=1`
    specific_demand : Float, optional
        Specific thermal demand of the building in kWh/(m^2 a)
        Requires `method=1`
    profile_type : str, optional
        Thermal SLP profile name
        Requires `method=1`
        - `HEF` : Single family household
        - `HMF` : Multi family household
        - `GBA` : Bakeries
        - `GBD` : Other services
        - `GBH` : Accomodations
        - `GGA` : Restaurants
        - `GGB` : Gardening
        - `GHA` : Retailers
        - `GHD` : Summed load profile business, trade and services
        - `GKO` : Banks, insurances, public institutions
        - `GMF` : Household similar businesses
        - `GMK` : Automotive
        - `GPD` : Paper and printing
        - `GWA` : Laundries
