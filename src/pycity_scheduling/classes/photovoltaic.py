class Photovoltaic(ElectricalEntity, pv.PV):
    """
    Extension of pyCity_base class PV for scheduling purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    environment : Environment
        Common Environment instance.
    method : int
        - 0 : Calculate PV power based on an area in m^2 equipped with PV panels
        - 1 : Calculate PV power based on the installed PV peak power in kWp
    area : float, optional
        PV unit installation area in m^2 for `method=0`.
    peak_power : float, optional
        PV peak power installation in kWp for `method=1`.
    eta_noct : float, optional
        Electrical efficiency at NOCT conditions (without unit) for `method=0`.
        NOCT conditions: See manufacturer's data sheets or
        Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (4th ed.), page 759
    radiation_noct : float, optional
        Nominal solar radiation at NOCT conditions (in W/m^2)
        NOCT conditions: See manufacturer's data sheets or
        Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (4th ed.), page 759
    t_cell_noct : float, optional
        Nominal cell temperature at NOCT conditions (in degree Celsius)
        NOCT conditions: See manufacturer's data sheets or
        Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (4th ed.), page 759
    t_ambient_noct : float, optional
        Nominal ambient air temperature at NOCT conditions (in degree Celsius)
        NOCT conditions: See manufacturer's data sheets or
        Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (4th ed.), page 759
    alpha_noct : float, optional
        Temperature coefficient at NOCT conditions (without unit)
        NOCT conditions: See manufacturer's data sheets or
        Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes (4th ed.), page 759
    beta : float, optional
        Slope, the angle (in degree) between the plane of the surface in
        question and the horizontal. 0 <= beta <= 180. If beta > 90, the
        surface faces downwards.
    gamma : float, optional
        Surface azimuth angle. The deviation of the projection on a
        horizontal plane of the normal to the surface from the local
        meridian, with zero due south, east negative, and west positive.
        -180 <= gamma <= 180
    tau_alpha : float, optional
        Optical properties of the PV unit. Product of absorption and
        transmission coeffients.
        According to Duffie, Beckman - Solar Engineering of Thermal
        Processes (4th ed.), page 758, this value is typically close to 0.9
    force_renewables : bool, optional
        `True` if generation may not be reduced for optimization purposes.
