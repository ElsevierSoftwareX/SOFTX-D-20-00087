    Base class for all optimization algorithms.

    This class provides functionality common to all algorithms which are
    able to optimize City Districts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    city_district : CityDistrict
    solver : str, optional
        Solver to use for solving (sub-)problems.
    solver_options : dict, optional
        Options to pass to calls to the solver. Keys are the name of
        the functions being called and are one of `__call__`, `set_instance`,
        `solve`.

        - `__call__` is the function being called when generating an instance
          with the pyomo SolverFactory.  Additionally to the options provided,
          `node_ids` is passed to this call containing the IDs of the entities
          being optimized.
        - `set_instance` is called when a pyomo Model is set as an instance of
          a persistent solver.
        - `solve` is called to perform an optimization. If not set,
          `save_results` and `load_solutions` may be set to false to provide a
          speedup.

    mode : str, optional
        Specifies which set of constraints to use.

        - `convex`  : Use linear constraints
        - `integer`  : May use non-linear constraints
    robustness : tuple, optional
        Tuple of two floats. First entry defines how many time steps are
        protected from deviations. Second entry defines the magnitude of
        deviations which are considered.
